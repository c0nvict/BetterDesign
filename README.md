### BetterDesign
## Purpose
BetterDesign is a simple python module to make styling command line applications easier.
## Usage
You can install this module using:
```
pip install BetterDesign
```
You can import this module using:
```py

```
Printing a table code example:

values = {
    "GitHub": "https://github.com/c0nvict/BetterDesign",

Centering a string code example:
```py
import BetterDesign as bd

string = "Hello world!"

print(bd.center(string)) # this works for multiple line strings and allows you to use the "end" keyword unlike python's native center.
```

There is some other stuff that I have not shown examples for yet, just feel free to read the code or message me on discord at convict#0001!
## Updates and new features
If I ever update this, it will be uncommon since I only made this when I was bored. I do plan to eventually add some stuff with colors, feel free to submit a pull request if you add anything!
## Credits
This was solely developed by <a href="https://github.com/c0nvict">c0nvict</a>, this isn't supposed to be a huge project, just some things to make your application better
## Known errors
Centering BetterDesign tables is broken
